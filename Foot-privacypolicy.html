    <p>Our Privacy Policy was updated on July 22rd, 2021.
<br>
        Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
    </div>
    <strong>ABOUT US</strong>
    <p>Xiaomi Singapore Pte. Ltd., Xiaomi Technology Netherlands B.V., and its affiliated companies within the Xiaomi Group (hereinafter refer to as “Xiaomi”, “we”, “our” or “us”) take your privacy very seriously.

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Xiaomi collects, uses, discloses, processes and protects any personal information that you give us or that we collect from you. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when you use the services on our platform, it will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and/or our terms and conditions for users. Under this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual, either from that information alone or from that information combined with other information Xiaomi has access to about that individual, except as otherwise specifically provided by applicable laws in your region. We will use your personal information strictly in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        TRUSTe</p>
        <p>1 What information is collected by us and how do we use it?</p>

          <p> 1.1 What information is collected by us
            
            In order to provide our services to you, we will ask you to provide personal information that is necessary to provide those services to you. We will only collect the information that is necessary for its specified, concrete, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. You have the right to choose whether or not to provide the information we have requested, but in most cases, if you do not provide your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our services or respond to your queries.</p>
            
          <p> 1.1.1 Information you provide to us
            
            We may collect any personal information you provide to us, which is necessary for the service you choose. For example, you may provide your Mi Account information when you log in; you may provide us your email address if you wish to receive news or updates from us; you may provide us your mobile phone number, address, name, postal code, order, invoicing details if you use retailing services.
        </p>

            Information related to your application usage, including application basic information, such as application version, application settings (region, language, time zone, and font) and application status record (e.g. downloading, installing, updating, deleting).
            </p>
            <p>
            Information generated when you use a service, such as your messages and ratings in customer support services.</p>
            
           <p> Location information.</p>
            
          <p> Log information. Information related to your use of certain features, apps, and websites. For example, cookies and IP addresses.

        </p>
        <p>
            When permitted by law, we will collect information about you from third-party sources. For example,
            
            we may also obtain certain information such as account IDs and nicknames from third-party social network services (e.g. when you use a social network account to sign in to our service);
            
            information about you that others provided to us (e.g. your delivery address that other users may provide to us when they buy products for you).
            
         </p>   
          <p> 1.1.4 Non-personally identifiable information
            
            We may also collect other types of information which are not directly or indirectly linked to an individual and which may not be defined as personal information according to applicable local laws.

The purpose for such collecting is to improve the services we provide to you. The type and amount of information collected depends on how you use our services.
        </p>  
          <p>
        Such data is not personal information as it cannot be used to identify you. However, if we combine non-personal information with personal information, such information will be treated as personal information.
    </p> <p> 
            1.2 How we use the personal information that we collect
            
            The purpose of collecting personal information is to provide you with our services, and to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements. This involves:
            
            Providing, processing, maintaining, improving and developing our services to you, such as delivery, after-sales, customer support.
            
            Handling your questions or requests about our services, such as answering customer inquiries.

If you no longer wish to receive certain types of promotional materials, you may opt-out by the method provided in the message (such as the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the message) unless otherwise specified under applicable laws. Please also see “Your rights” below.
            
            Providing personalized services and content. We may recommend personalized products, services and activities, based on information you generate when using our services, such as purchase history, website browsing history, and searching history. You have the right to opt-out from receiving personalized recommendations and to object to profiling, including that carried out for direct marketing purposes, at any time. To do so, you can turn it on or off at any time within the phone settings or contact us at https://privacy.mi.com/support. Please also see “Your rights” below.
            
            Internal purposes ssuch as data analysis, research, and development of statistical information related to the use of our services for improvement. For example, machine learning or model algorithm training is performed after de-identification processing
            
            Storing and maintaining information related to you for our business operations (such as business statistics) or for fulfilling our legal obligations.
            
            Other purposes with your consent.
        </p> <p> 
            Here are more detailed examples on how we use your information (which may include personal information):
            
            Processing your purchase order. Information related to e-commerce orders is used for processing the purchase order and related after-sales services, including customer support and re-delivery. In addition, the order number will be used to cross-check the order with the delivery partner as well as to record delivery of the parcel. Recipient information, including name, address, phone number and postal code will be used for delivery purposes. Your email address is used to send you parcel tracking information. A list of purchased items is used for printing an invoice and enables the customer to see which items are in the parcel.
            
            Collecting user feedback. The feedback you choose to provide is valuable in helping Xiaomi make improvements to our services. In order to follow up on the feedback you have chosen to provide, Xiaomi may correspond with you using the personal information that you have provided and keep records of this correspondence for problem solving and service improvement.
            
            Sending notices. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as notices about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Since such information is critical to your interaction with Xiaomi, it is not recommended that you refuse to receive such information.
            
            We may combine this information with other information (including information across different services or devices such as computers, mobile phones, and other connected devices) to provide and improve our services, and content. For example, we may use your Mi Account details in all services you use that require a Mi Account. Furthermore, in order to improve your experience and our services, while complying with relevant laws and regulations or with your consent, we may sort out information from different services or equipment from you or related to you to form a label, to provide suggestions, customized content, and personalized features. For example, using your search history in the browser to recommend products or services which you would be interested on mi.com. And according to the reasons for the aforementioned combination and the requirements of applicable laws, we will provide you with specific control mechanisms for such combination. You have the right to opt-out of receiving direct marketing from us and automated decision-making, etc. In order to exercise these rights, you can contact us at https://privacy.mi.com/support or refer to the control mechanisms described in the separate privacy policy for each product. Please also see “Your rights” below.
